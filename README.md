Smart Vivarium
Smart Vivarium is an IoT-based system designed to help enthusiasts care for exotic pets — such as frogs — especially in environments that don't match their natural habitat.


Project Overview
This project allows users to monitor and control the temperature and humidity inside a vivarium (enclosed habitat) using a NodeMCU V3 board. It supports both manual and automatic control modes.
Originally, this project included:
- C++/C code running on a NodeMCU V3.
- A mobile application written in React Native. (currently lost)
- A web interface for near-real-time monitoring. (basic prototype)

⚠️ Note: Most of the mobile app code was lost and is not included in this repository.

Features (At the Time of Completion)
- Monitor near-real-time temperature and humidity.
- Switch between manual and automatic control modes via mobile applicaiton.
- Web dashboard for viewing data. (basic functionality)
- Mobile control app. (planned but missing)

Tech Stack
- Hardware: NodeMCU V3, DHT11/DHT22 Sensor. (for temp & humidity)
- Firmware: C/C++ (Arduino-style)
- Web: HTML/CSS/JS or PHP (optional monitoring : not available in repo)
- Mobile App: React Native (not available in repo)

Inspiration
This project was inspired by my interest in exotic animals and smart automation. It was also part of my academic work and helped me learn more about microcontrollers, sensors, and integrating hardware with software.

Notes
This project is no longer actively maintained or updated. While the mobile app is missing, the main logic (in C++) is may still available and might help others designing similar systems with NodeMCU and sensors.
